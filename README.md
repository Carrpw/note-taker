### Description of Process

I started this project by making more files for the different types of routes I was going to make. The first one was the html routes and then the api routes. The html routes were simple get routes to allow the two html files to access each other. The api routes were more difficult and involved me creating a get route to allow the api to the notes, anther get route to for the api to get to the note ids, a post route so that the new notes could be added, and finally a delete route so that the  user could delete any notes that they previously added. Then I added the node_modules with an npm install and a gitignore. I was having some trouble with my routes after that and moved the all the  files I edited out of the folders they had been to the main folder, which messed up the pre-set routes in the pre-made files. So then I had to go back through all the files and fix the different routes so that the files could access each other again. Once done with that I consolidated the two routes files into the same file to make the list of files shorter. Finally I made sure that heroku had access to the github repository so that I could depoly this app and that it would be accessible.
